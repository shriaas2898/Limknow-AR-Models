# Contribute
Thanks for deciding to contribute to our initiative, we welcome 3D artists to contribute AR models for **Limknow**. Follow these steps to contribute your model:
### 1. Choosing a model you want to work on
  * Go to [AR Models list](ar-models-list), where you can find details of model along with a reference picture.
  * Once you have chosen a model to work on create an issue with model name(if it doesn't already exists), in the issue body write details of the model and mention that you would like to work on it.
  * A maintainer will assign you the issue if no one is already working on it and once assigned you can start working on the issue
### 2. Getting the repository
  * Fork the repository to your profile by clicking `fork` button on top right.
### 3. Creating model
  * You can use any tool to create 3D model like Blender, zbrush etc.
  * Once you are done export the model in `.glb` format.
### 4. Preparing files 
  * Files required:
    * Screenhot of model from *front*,*side* and *top* view with names `front-model-name`, `side-model-name` and `top-model-name` respectively.
    * `model-name.glb` file for the model. 
    * Reference image used while creating model.
  * Uploading the files:
    * Go to your forked repository and inside model folder click on `add file` -> `create file`
    * Name the new file as `Model Name/README.md`. This will create a folder with `Model Name` inside models folder.
    * Add the details of your model in this `README.md`.
    * Once you are done scroll down and commit the new file.
    * Now go back to folder for your model and upload files which you prepared in [Step 3]()
### 5. Adding your model to main repository.
  * Once you are done with all the above step go back to your forked repository, here you should see a message saying *your fork is `n` commits ahead...*, click on *create a pull request*
  * In the title mention issue number which you have worked on e.g `Fixed #23: Added 3D model for <Model-Name>`
  * In the issue body write the details about your model and any other point you want the reviewer to know.
  * Once your are done submit the Pull Request.
### 6. Updating Pull request.
Depending on a PR a reviwer may merge your PR if everything looks good or may ask you to make some changes.
  * If reviewer requests some changes:
    * Make the changes and upload files on your forked repository, it will automatically get reflected in your Pull Request.
  * Once your PR gets merged, that is it you have successfully added your model to **Limknow**!!
